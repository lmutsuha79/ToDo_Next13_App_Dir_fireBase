# Next13 & FireBase Todo App

## a fully functional Todo App using the new version of Next13 with the App directory and Firebase.

I created this app to test the new version of next js which is Next13 with the new App directory, I have used Firebase as a backend (database + auth), and tailwind css for the general styling of the app

the app contains the following features: 
* Create new notes or tasks with a title, description, and due date.
* Mark a task as done
* change the order of the tasks using drag and drop 
* The app contains toast notifications when an event happening 

I will add more features ones I'm done working with the previous one.
